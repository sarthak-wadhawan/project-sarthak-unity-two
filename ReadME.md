project-sarthak-unity-two/Assets/UIManager.cs

I created the scene with the objects first last week but did not upload to github(forgot).

I created three objects, and the ground(plane)
The three objects have a rigid body.
The three objects can collide.
There is gravity.
I learnt the basics, how to create a scene, how to create objects, gained knowledge about unity and C#.

I did it without code using unity first (for learning).
Then I did the required tasks using C# code.

After that, I worked on the extra credit tasks and learned about buttons sliders and toggles(mainly the UI aspect for the scene)
I'm using just one button for resetting the scene AND to randomize the objects.
